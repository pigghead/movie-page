# Movie Page
Created a simple html, css, javascript webpage. Explored accessing the Movie Databse api (https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=en-US). Deployed a database on MongoDb to collect reviews about a movie, including user's name & the content of their review. Utilized postman for testing CRUD.
